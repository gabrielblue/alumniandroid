## 🎯 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### 🚀 Option A: Quick Start in Cursor (Recommended)

1. **Install Android Studio or Android SDK:**
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   # Or just SDK tools: https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

3. **Run your app:**
   ```bash
   # Test build (will work once SDK is installed)
   ./quick-deploy.sh
   ```

### 🌐 Option B: Use GitHub Codespaces (Instant Setup)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with bug fixes and deployment setup"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alumni-system.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Open in Codespaces** - GitHub will automatically set up Android development environment

3. **Your CI/CD pipeline** will automatically build and test your app

## 🔥 Set Up Firebase (Required - 5 minutes)

1. **Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)**
2. **Create new project** → "Alumni System"
3. **Add Android app:**
   - Package name: `com.example.allumnisystem`
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Replace `app/google-services.json` with your file

4. **Enable services:**
   - Authentication → Email/Password
   - Firestore Database → Test mode
   - Storage → Default settings

## 📱 Deploy to Google Play Store

### 1. Create Release Keystore (One-time setup)
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore alumni-system-release.keystore \
        -alias alumni-system -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### 2. Create keystore.properties file:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD  
keyAlias=alumni-system
storeFile=../alumni-system-release.keystore
```

### 3. Build release app:
```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease  # Creates .aab file for Play Store
```

### 4. Upload to Google Play Console:
- Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
- Create new app → Upload .aab file
- Fill in store listing details
- Submit for review
